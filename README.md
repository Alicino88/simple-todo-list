A simple todo list built with React.js
The app allows to enter a new todo and then render it on a list. The list can also be filtered according to category.

Interesting concepts reviewed while building the app:
- Lifting-state up
- Conditional rendering
- filtering displayed content

The app hasn't been styled yet.
